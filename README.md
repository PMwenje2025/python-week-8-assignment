Assignment Overview

This assignment will guide you through a basic analysis of the CORD-19 research dataset and creating a simple Streamlit application to display your findings. This simplified version focuses on fundamental data analysis skills appropriate for beginners.

Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

Practice loading and exploring a real-world dataset

Learn basic data cleaning techniques

Create meaningful visualizations

Build a simple interactive web application

Present data insights effectively

Dataset Information

We'll work with the metadata.csv file from the CORD-19


This project uses the **metadata.csv** file from the [CORD-19 Research Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

⚠️ **Note:** The dataset is too large to include in this repository.  
Please download only the `metadata.csv` file from Kaggle and place it in the root folder of this project before running the scripts or the Streamlit app.
